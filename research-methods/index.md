# Research Methods

This section focuses on programming techniques specifically applied to cognitive science research methods and experimental paradigms.

## Programming for Experimental Psychology

Tools and techniques for designing, implementing, and analyzing psychological experiments.

Key areas:
- Stimulus creation and presentation
- Response collection and processing
- Experimental design implementation
- Behavioral data analysis
- Eye tracking methods

## Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences

Programming applications for cognitive and neural research.

Focus areas:
- Cognitive experiment implementation
- Reaction time paradigms
- Attention and perception tasks
- Decision-making experiments
- Cognitive simulation models

## Neural Data Science

Methods for analyzing and visualizing neural data.

Key techniques:
- Single unit analysis
- EEG data processing
- fMRI data analysis
- Neural time series analysis
- Machine learning for neural data

## Integration with Learning Tracks

As I develop programming skills through my learning tracks, I'll apply them to these research methods, creating a bridge between theoretical computer science concepts and practical cognitive science applications.

## Current Focus

I'm currently establishing the foundational programming skills needed to implement basic experiments and simulations, with a focus on reaction time paradigms and working memory experiments.
