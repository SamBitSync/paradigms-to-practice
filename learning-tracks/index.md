# Learning Tracks

These tracks document my progression through foundational programming and cognitive science concepts, focusing on structured learning resources.

## How to Design Programs (HtDP)

Systematic approach to program design using design recipes and data-driven development.

[View HtDP Notes](/paradigms-to-practice/learning-tracks/htdp/)

Key concepts:
- Design recipes for systematic program development
- Data-driven program design
- Abstraction and modular thinking
- Problem decomposition techniques

## PyBites Challenges

Progressive Python skill building through structured challenges.

[View PyBites Notes](/paradigms-to-practice/learning-tracks/pybites/)

Current focus:
- Core Python data structures
- Functional programming techniques
- Algorithmic thinking
- Test-driven development

## Allen Downey's "Think" Books

Computational thinking development through practical examples.

[View Downey Books Notes](/paradigms-to-practice/learning-tracks/downey-books/)

Books in progress:
- Think Python: Programming fundamentals
- Think Stats: Statistical analysis
- Think Bayes: Bayesian methods
- Think Complexity: Complex systems

## Testing Methodology

Learning PyTest for experimental rigor and hypothesis testing.

[View Testing Notes](/paradigms-to-practice/learning-tracks/testing/)

Key skills:
- Test-driven development
- Hypothesis testing in code
- Reproducible experimentation
- Scientific rigor in programming

## Data Science Tools

Tools and techniques for cognitive data analysis.

[View Data Science Notes](/paradigms-to-practice/learning-tracks/datascience/)

Tool focus:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Visualization techniques
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning applications

## Current Progress

I'm currently focusing on building a solid foundation with HtDP's design recipes and completing introductory PyBites challenges.
