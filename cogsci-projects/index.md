# Cognitive Science Projects

This section documents my practical implementations of cognitive science concepts, creating a bridge between theoretical understanding and programming application.

## Cognitive Models

Computational implementations of cognitive processes and mental structures.

[View Cognitive Models](/paradigms-to-practice/cogsci-projects/models/)

Current projects:
- Working memory model with capacity constraints
- Attentional filter simulation
- Spreading activation semantic network
- Bayesian inference model for causal reasoning

## Experimental Paradigms

Programming implementations of classic and novel cognitive experiments.

[View Experimental Paradigms](/paradigms-to-practice/cogsci-projects/experiments/)

Projects in development:
- Stroop task implementation
- N-back working memory task
- Lexical decision paradigm
- Visual search experiment
- Decision-making under uncertainty

## Visualizations

Tools for visualizing cognitive data and theoretical constructs.

[View Cognitive Visualizations](/paradigms-to-practice/cogsci-projects/visualizations/)

Visualization projects:
- Reaction time distribution viewer
- Memory capacity visualization
- Attentional spotlight model
- Cognitive architecture diagram generator

## Integration of Learning Tracks

These projects represent the practical application of skills developed in my learning tracks:
- HtDP design recipes provide systematic approach to model development
- PyBites challenges build the programming skills needed for implementation
- Allen Downey's books inform computational thinking for cognitive modeling
- PyTest ensures rigor in validating model predictions
- Data science tools enable analysis of experimental results

## Current Projects

I'm currently in the planning and initial implementation phase for a working memory model that incorporates capacity constraints and interference effects, using Python data structures to represent memory items and processes.
