Today marks the beginning of my structured journey to bridge the gap between paradigmic cognition and practical programming implementation. As someone who thinks in systems and concepts, I've always struggled with the actual implementation details.

## Why This Approach

I've tried to learn programming several times before, but the "how" never followed from the "why" as I expected it would. This time, I'm taking a structured approach:

1. Building a foundation with HtDP's systematic design approach
2. Practicing incrementally with PyBites challenges
3. Applying everything to cognitive science problems that interest me

This digital garden will help me track my thoughts and progress, even if I'm the only one who ever reads it.
